NOTE: This course was taken as an auditor. Code passes all given tests but may not pass the Coursera grader

# Summary of each project
Project 1: Boolean Functions and Gate Logic - Translated boolean algebra into logic gates (AND, OR, NAND), the foundation for computers.

Project 2: Boolean Arithmetic and the ALU - Created adders and an ALU from the previous gates.

Project 3: Memory - Created RAM by scaling up from flip-flop gates to one-bit gates to create n-bit gates.

Project 4: Machine Language - Wrote a Mult and a Fill program in Assembly. Assembly gives us a feasible way to communicate with the computer instead of binary.

Project 5: Computer Architecture - Combined previous knowledge to form the Hack computer based on the Von Neumann Architecture which features ROM, CPU, RAM, I/O.

Project 6: Assembler: Wrote an assembler that turns mnemonic assembly code into binary based on the computer hardware/architecture.

Project 7: Virtual Machine Stack Arithmetic - The Jack OOP language has a two step compilation process, the compiler and the virtual machine. The stack data structure is implemnted to carry out the translation of VM language into assembly.

Project 8: Virtual Machine Program Control - The VM is extended to include program flow and function calling capabilites.

Project 9: High-Level Language - Practice writing in the Jack OOP language. I wrote a game of Hangman that utlized the low level capabilites of the language by drawing pixels (setting memory addresses to corresponding binary values)
and reading input from the keyboard.

Project 10: Compiler Syntax Analysis - Created a syntax analyzer that parses a Jack file and seperates the code into tokens of meaning.

Project 11: Compiler Code Generation - Turned the syntax analyzer into a VM code generating compiler through 5 software modules: compiler/driver, tokenizer, symbol table, VM code output writer, recursive compilation engine.

Project 12: Operating System - This OS acts as a bridge between the hardware and the high-level programmer. Gives the programmer access to the keyboard, the screen, arrays, etc.
